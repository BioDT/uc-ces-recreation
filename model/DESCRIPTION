Description: This package provides the BioDT Recreational Potential Model,
    which was developed by scientists at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
    The model takes a geographic area and a collection of numerical parameters
    that we call a recreational 'persona', and computes a scalar metric that
    represents what we call the 'recreational potential' for each point or
    pixel in the area considered.
