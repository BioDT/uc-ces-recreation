# BioDT Recreation Potential model

This is the version of the Recreational Potential model and Shiny App that was used as part of the 'SPEAK' study in Febrary-April 2025.

The purpose of tagging this as a discrete release is just so that there is a record of what the app looked like during the SPEAK study. 

We expect to do another release based on feedback from this study. We will also publish the data which will allow the model/app to be run by anyone.

You can run the shiny app (`app.R`) in the usual way. However, at this point the data is not public so you will not be able to actually compute the recreational potential.
