# Cultural Ecosystem Services - Recreation Potential Model Version 2

More versatile version of the recreation potential model from uc-ces (https://github.com/BioDT/uc-ces/tree/main/recreation_model) with larger geograpic extent and custom personas. Developed by Chris Andrews.

The main RShiny App is called BioDT_RP_Scot_RShiny_app_Reduced_Model.R It won't run fully without access to the raster files which should be in the input folders. 

Once a local version has been established, edit the filepath to the "home_folder" (parent folder for repository) in the main script.
