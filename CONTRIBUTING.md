# How to contribute

## Submitting changes

Please create a branch or fork based on `develop` for your development, and make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) back to `develop` with your edits.

In the pull request, please explain what changes you have made and why.


## Development checklist

After making a change, please complete these steps before committing the changes:

1. Write/update documentation

2. Write/update tests and check they pass

3. Regenerate the `NAMESPACE` file using `devtools::document()`

4. Run some checks using `devtools::check()` (in particular look for any errors and warnings)

5. Ensure the style and formatting is consistent

6. Commit your changes

You may find the script `scripts/dev.sh` helpful for reducing typing during this process.
